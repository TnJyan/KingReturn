# KingReturn
game rules:The return of the king smart node contract: static equity value, shared equity value, and management equity value.
            I. Static Equity Value
            Smart node contract: Ethereum's fully decentralized intelligent algorithm has a daily equity value of 30-130.
            100USDT to 5000USDT (an integral multiple of 100) can participate in the smart node contract once every 24 hours. When Ethereum is fully decentralized to execute smart node contracts, 1% of the contract amount goes to the treasure chest (small game). 1% of the contract amount to the technical team as a platform service fee.
            Second, share equity value
            Smart node contract: 20% of the value of first-level equity
            Smart node contract: 10% of secondary equity value
            Third, the value of management equity
            Ordinary nodes: 100 effective smart node contracts on the network and 1000U of own smart node contracts (5% of the smart node contract equity value)
            City node: two networks reach common nodes, and their own smart node contract is 2000U. (10% of the smart node contract equity value)
            Alliance nodes: The two networks reach the city node, and their own smart node contract is 3000U. (15% of smart node contract equity)
            Super node: two networks reach the alliance node, and their own smart node contract is 4000U. (20% of the smart node contract equity value)
            Genesis node: The two networks reach the super node, and their own smart node contract is 5000U. (25% of the equity value of smart node contracts) 10% of equity value
            King node: The two networks reach the genesis node, and their own smart node contract is 10,000U. (30% of the smart node contract equity value) Peer equity value of 5%
