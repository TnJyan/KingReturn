# KingReturn  <\br>
game rules:The return of the king smart node contract: static equity value, shared equity value, and management equity value.  <\br>
        	I. Static Equity Value  <\br>
            Smart node contract: Ethereum's fully decentralized intelligent algorithm has a daily equity value of 30-130.  <\br>
            100USDT to 5000USDT (an integral multiple of 100) can participate in the smart node contract once every 24 hours. When Ethereum is fully decentralized to execute smart node contracts, 1% of the contract amount goes to the treasure chest (small game). 1% of the contract amount to the technical team as a platform service fee.  <\br>
            Second, share equity value  <\br>
            Smart node contract: 20% of the value of first-level equity  <\br>
            Smart node contract: 10% of secondary equity value  <\br>
            Third, the value of management equity  <\br>
            Ordinary nodes: 100 effective smart node contracts on the network and 1000U of own smart node contracts (5% of the smart node contract equity value)  <\br>
            City node: two networks reach common nodes, and their own smart node contract is 2000U. (10% of the smart node contract equity value)  <\br>
            Alliance nodes: The two networks reach the city node, and their own smart node contract is 3000U. (15% of smart node contract equity)  <\br>
            Super node: two networks reach the alliance node, and their own smart node contract is 4000U. (20% of the smart node contract equity value)  <\br>
            Genesis node: The two networks reach the super node, and their own smart node contract is 5000U. (25% of the equity value of smart node contracts) 10% of equity value  <\br>
            King node: The two networks reach the genesis node, and their own smart node contract is 10,000U. (30% of the smart node contract equity value) Peer equity value of 5%  <\br>
            Remark  <\br>
            Withdrawal rules:  <\br>
            Withdraw money once every 24 hours, a multiple of 100USDT  <\br>
            The highest reference is the total amount of valid smart node contracts.  <\br>
            Withdrawal fee:  <\br>
            Below 1000USDT 3USDT  <\br>
            Above 1000USDT and 5USDT.  <\br>
